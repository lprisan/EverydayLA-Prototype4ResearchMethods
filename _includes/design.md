## Plan/Activities

Planned time: ???? mins

*Note: the links to the teacher dashboards (which show everyone's responses) probably should be hidden away (and/or the teacher can show it on the projector after the fact), so that students do not copy each other?*

### 1. Intro to the session goals and structure **[5']**
* Everybody should navigate to this website, at [...goo.gl.URL...](...goo.gl.URL...){:target="_blank"}{:style="font-size:300%"}
<!--* ![... or scan this!](assets/qr.png){:height="450px"}-->
* The teacher explains the goals of the day, and the structure of the session

### 2. Checking on the readings assignment (Individual) **[10']**
* Students go on to [this form](){:target="_blank"} and answer a few questions about the reading assignment of the day
    * This may include multiple choice questions, as well as a few more freeform ones (to be discussed in #3)
    * Should these forms include a field with the name? (for assessment or later matching)
* Teacher gets an overview of the responses in [a dashboard or Google Forms](){:target="_blank"}
* (Optional) Maybe the teacher could also respond to the questions, to set the "right response" (even for the more qualitative NLP, it would be interesting to compare those with students'?)

### 3. Discussion about the readings (Pairs) **[15']**
* Students are asked to discuss about the more nuanced/qualitative questions
* Students put their pair's responses in [this form](){:target="_blank"}
* Teacher gets an overview of the responses (via simple NLP?) in [this dashboard](){:target="_blank"}

### 4. The Lecture **[???']**

... any exercise to see how the ideas of the readings can be applied to each students' own proposal??

### 5. Wrap-up and questionnaire (this would be done ALL sessions) [3']
* The teacher asks students to reflect (anonymously) on their learning experience today (and reflects him/herself), [using the Prolearning tool](){:target="_blank"}.
* IMPORTANT: Remark that this is for the teacher's own understanding and the improvement of the course, and that this kind of reflection/self-assessment exercises have been shown to be very effective in increasing learning outcomes
* Example questions (others are also possible):
    * I had read fully today's assigned readings (yes/no)
    * I only skimmed through today's assigned readings (yes/no)
    * I had the opportunity to express my views/opinions on the day's topic (yes/no)
    * I think I recall quite well the main features of the readings that we had for today (yes/no)
    * I feel today's method can be applied to my research proposal (yes/no)
    * I think I was engaged and/or paying attention for about ... % of the lesson's time (1-100)
    * I was able to participate actively in today's class for (minutes) (1-100)
    * If I had a test on today's topic, I would score... (1-100)
